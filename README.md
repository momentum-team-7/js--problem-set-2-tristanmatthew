# JavaScript Practice


## Directions

There are 13 problems of increasing difficulty to solve in `homework.js`. Tests are included to check your answers. To run the tests, open `index.html` in a browser. The tests will stop on the first incorrect answer; you will have to refresh once you update `homework.js`.

You can look at `tests.js` if you have trouble in order to see what is being tested. `tests.js` contains JavaScript that you have not seen yet, but it should be understandable.

When done, read `tests.js` thoroughly and take notes on any questions you have after reading it.
